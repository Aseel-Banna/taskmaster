# taskmaster

This is an Android app related to tasks.

In this app, we have three activities:
* Main Activity: it has two buttons( Add Task and All Tasks) to allow the user moving throw other activities<br/>
For lab 27, we added three buttons with different titles fot tasks. Once the user clicks on the task button, it will start the details activity.<br/>
Also, there is a title for the tasks buttons that is related to the user name.<br/>
